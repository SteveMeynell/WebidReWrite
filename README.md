# WebidReWrite
I need to reWrite this.  Don't ask me why but their are so many places for improvement on this originally great project that I just need to.

I will add to this file as need be.

What I'd like to change:
  Layout of the admin section is hard to navigate.  I want to put things in different areas and group them together in similar 
  sections.  ie: Company information, site information, admin information
  
  Themes are hard to create with all the hard coded information.
